    Settlement -> Pool: Get total pre-token supply
    Settlement -> Pool: Get trader's pre-token balance

    Settlement -> Settlement: Calculate compensation = share * total_forfeited_collateral
    Settlement -> Pool: Burn pre-token
    Settlement -> Pool: Transfer compensation (base token) to trader
    Settlement --> AMM: Return compensation amount
    deactivate Settlement
    
    AMM --> Trader: Send compensation (partial value in base token)
